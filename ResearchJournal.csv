leftDoubleImage,My Boyfriend Came Back from the War - Olia Lialina,Russian artist and net art pioneer,"Olia Lialina is a huge artist in net art, and My Boyfriend Came Back from the War (1996) is widely considered one of the most influential early web artworks. She built it using HTML frames and simple black-and-white imagery. Her work invites users to click through a fragmented narrative, a woman recounting a lover's return from war, though the meaning is never fully resolved. The structure of her website is disorienting as images reload within nested frames and text splits or contradicts itself.

This piece illustrates a form of storytelling that is deliberately nonlinear and emotionally ambiguous, almost like a of refusal of clarity. I chose this reference as I found this piece to be visually quite simple but hold a strong conceptual frame work. Her exploration of  emotional awkwardness and shyness really helped inspire the framework of integrating a human voice within an online website. Her work taught me that and online interface can be emotionally expressive, even when technically limited.",https://static.frieze.com/files/inline-images/web-mbcbftw-netscape-3.jpeg, https://elephant.art/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/My-Boyfriend-Came-Back-from-the-War-1996.png," Screenshot from My Boyfriend Came Back from the War, 1996"," Another screenshot from My Boyfriend Came Back from the War, 1996",http://www.teleportacia.org/war/," NetArt, EarlyWeb, Hypertext, Interface"
leftDoubleImage,Mouchette.org - Martine Neddam,Dutch artist creating fictional internet identities,"Martine Neddam’s Mouchette.org (1997) presents itself as the personal homepage of a 13-year-old girl. Mouchette is an invented persona, and the site is deliberately a little bit unsettling. Users are invited to vote on whether she should die, to confess secrets, or to respond to ambiguously suggestive questions. The aesthetic is low-resolution and a bit cruide, with bright colours and cartoonish icons masking darker undertones of sexuality, death, and manipulation.
Mouchette highlights an intersection of performance, persona, and interface. I chose her work as a reference because Mouchette captured the kind of girl online persona that I was interested in designing into my own interfaces. I was really inspired by the way she made online interactions feels emotionally risky or really intimate. It also speaks to the idea of digital girlhood as something hyper-visible and hyper-staged. Mouchette weaponises cuteness and interactivity to disturb the viewer and creates a female-coded interface that won’t behave. Her refusal to clarify her identity feels radical and empowering, especially within the design norms of the web today.",images/mouchette.png,images/mouchette2.png," Homepage of Mouchette.org, 1997"," Mouchette.org 7 songs, 1997", https://www.mouchette.org/,"Persona, NetArt, Girlhood, UIPlay"
leftDoubleImage,Someone  - Lauren Lee McCarthy,"Artist, coder, p5.js creator","SOMEONE (2017) is a performative project by artist and coder Lauren Lee McCarthy, in which visitors could act as a stand-in for a smart home assistant like Alexa. She connects remotely to participants’ homes and controls their lights, appliances, and digital infrastructure. Participants schedule sessions where she monitors their space via livestream and responds to vocal requests, or offers her presence without being prompted. Visitors would hear smart home occupants call out for “Someone"", prompting the visitors to step in as their home automation assistant and respond to their needs.
Her work exposes the scope of digital responsiveness and how connection and control can be blurred when integrated by  technology. I was drawn to this project for its exploration of digital vulnerability in the way she has chosen to make herself hyper-visible while operating a rigid, performative system. SOMEONE helped me see how discomfort, exposure, and emotional ambiguity can become design elements in themselves. McCarthy’s use of p5.js to create performative environments has been a key influence on how I approach interactivity and how to explore the bridge between people and technology.

leftDoubleImage,mollysoda.exposed - Molly Soda,Digital artist and performer,"Molly Soda’s mollysoda.exposed is website for a confessional space and an archive of browser-based performances. The website is structured like a lo-fi homepage from the early 2000s, exploring cluttered GIFs, blinking text, webcam stills, embedded videos, and handwritten text. Her website deliberately feels very personal, unstable, excessive. Each subpage offers a different window into Soda’s practice of emotional exposure and digital self-performance. She explores private diary entries to looping video works of her crying, sleeping, or talking to the camera.
What draws me to this site is her embrace of digital vulnerability. The browser becomes both a container and a stage, where the interface is affectively overloaded and never really polished. Soda exposes herself through broken links, overlapping media, and glitched formatting that mimic emotional overwhelm. In my workbook, I’ve been experimenting with emotional code, interaction as performance, and HTML as a poetic structure. Her website helped visualise the idea of embedding intimacy with the architecture of web,  in the way things load, misalign, loop, or feel like too much.

leftDoubleImage,Concrete Cowgirl - Matilda Sutherland ,Designer exploring poetic code,"Concrete Cowgirl is a browser-based concrete poem by Australian designer and artist Matilda Sutherland, created  using HTML and CSS. The piece consists of a horizontally scrolling page where fragmented lines of text appear, repeat, stutter, and disappear across a visual field. The experience is shaped by the slow pace, spatial rhythm, and visual arrangement of text-as-code.
This work helped expand my understanding  of how the browser is not  merely a visual interface, but can act as a poetic and affective space. It challenged the assumption that interaction must be dynamic or gratifying in order to be meaningful. Concrete Cowgirl demonstrates that minimal gesture, even something as subtle as the timing and placement of words, can carry emotional weight. Its quiet refusal to entertain or respond to user input became an important precedent for my own HTML-based sketches, which explore digital vulnerability and emotional presence. It also served as a compelling example of how coding practices can be articulated through subtle forms of web-based design.",images/matilda.png,images/matilda3.png,Screenshot from Concrete Cowgirl,Screenshot from Concrete Cowgirl,https://www.matildasutherland.com/concrete_cowgirl/,"HTMLPoetry, ConcretePoem, WebAesthetics"
leftDoubleImage,Delta_t,Online publication of code-based poetic works,"Delta_t is an ongoing digital poetry publication that features works that intersect code and poetic form. Artists and writers contribute pieces that play with syntax, visual rhythm, and use coding language as a form of execution and expression. Some entries are generative or animated, while others explore the poetics of structure using HTML tags or CSS selectors as constraints.
I selected Delta_t because it offers a framework for thinking about code not just as functional, but as aesthetic and symbolic. The contributors of Delta_t treat the technical structure of the web as a literary medium, something I aspire to do in my own work. The journal also helped me develop an approach to writing that treats interaction as a metaphor, where emotional uncertainty becomes a outlet for poetic design.",images/delta.png,images/delta3.png,Screenshot from Delta_t digital poetry journal,Screenshot from Delta_t digital poetry journal,https://code-poetry.com/delta_t,"CodePoetry, SyntaxArt, DigitalLiterature"
left,Real Virtual Feelings - Ani Liu,Artist working with biotech and emotion,"Real Virtual Feelings (2018) by Ani Liu is a speculative system that explores the emotional realities of romantic relationships through digital communication. Drawing from her own experience of a long-distance relationship, Liu created a machine learning-based interface that reads the emotional content of exchanged messages, when then analyzes sentiment, tone, and biometric inputs to generates an emotionally intelligent response. The project simulates what it might look like for a machine to love back. The work is still in progress but highlights a sort of tenderness around technology. I was incredibly struck by the way Liu doesn’t try to perfect emotional automation but rather she stages its failure. The system’s responses are strange, uncanny, sometimes too sincere or too neutral. In my own work, I was also interested in emotional systems, especially in contexts of vulnerability and anxiety. Real Virtual Feelings helped me think about how interaction design can reflect the fragility of emotional communication.

left,Cyberfeminism Index - Mindy Seu,"Curated index of cyberfeminist projects, practices, and theory","The Cyberfeminism Index, curated by Mindy Seu, is a digital archive of feminist, queer, and radical engagements with technology from the 1990s to today. It includes artworks, manifestos, theory, memes, code-based experiments, and speculative projects. The index offers an rich data visualisation of practitioners who challenge dominant narratives of tech culture. What makes the index unique is its non-hierarchical and intentionally incomplete structure. It resists linearity and instead encourages browsing and interruption.
I use this reference as a conceptual exploration as it offers a lineage of practice that frames my own explorations in interface poetics, emotional code, and feminine refusal. It reminds me that my instincts to slow down, to complicate interactivity and to code gently are not isolated gestures, but part of a broader cultural and political conversation. The index also models a different kind of authorship and research practice that is distributed and open-source.",https://alumni.gsd.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/CFI_PhotographybyHarryGriffin_ArtdirectionbyLauraCoombs.jpg,,Front Page from physical paperback of Cyberfeminism Index,,https://cyberfeminismindex.com,"Cyberfeminism, Archive, FeministTech, DigitalHistory"
leftDoubleImage,My Little Piece of Privacy -  Niklas Roy,Interactive installation artist,"My Little Piece of Privacy (2010) by Niklas Roy is an interactive installation in which a small curtain is placed in a street-facing window in Berlin and is computed to follow anyone passing by as they move in front of it. Instead of offering a view inside the shop, the curtain actively tracks and obscures the window from anyone trying to look inside. The technology involves a motion-tracking system attached to a mechanical rail. Roy disrupts conventional user expectation by building an interface that attempts to resist observation.
I was drawn to this work because it inverts the premise of surveillance and interaction. Rather than inviting engagement, it evades it, through a kind of performative aspect. However through this interaction, it contradicts and can tend to invite more engagement with the robot curtain, as people become intrigued. The curtain’s behaviour reveals the absurdity of constant visibility in both public and digital spaces. Roy’s installation highlighted for me that interaction doesn’t have to reward but can push back. It’s a model for designing systems in ways that feel personal and a little bit alive.",https://www.niklasroy.com/images/curtain_01.JPG,https://www.niklasroy.com/images/curtain_04.JPG,"Still from My Little Piece of Privacy, 2010","Still from My Little Piece of Privacy, 2010",https://www.niklasroy.com/project/88/my-little-piece-of-privacy,"InteractiveInstallation, Refusal, Surveillance, MotionSensor"
left,Pulse Topology - Rafael Lozano-Hemmer,Media artist working with architecture and biometric data,"Pulse Topology (2021) is an immersive biometric installation by Rafael Lozano-Hemmer composed of hundreds of suspended light bulbs that flicker in real time to the heartbeat of visitors. As each person interacts with the installation, their pulse is captured through a biometric sensor and added to the archive of lightbulbs. It creates a spatial atmosphere made from bodily presence. The result feels intimate and collective as it pulses with the traces of past participants.
What resonates with me in this work is its ability to transform biometric data into an emotional architecture, not as surveillance, but as a physical presence. The installation doesn’t visualise data to explain or optimise the body, but helps feel it through light, rhythm, and atmosphere. In my own project, I’ve experimented with microphone input and breath visualisation, using slow ambient visualisations to gesture toward mood and presence. Pulse Topology showed me how interactivity can be immersive in a way to evoke connection. It reminded me that biometric data and tracking can be used in a poetic sense and foster emotional responses.
