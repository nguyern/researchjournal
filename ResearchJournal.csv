leftDoubleImage,My Boyfriend Came Back from the War - Olia Lialina,Russian artist and net art pioneer,"Olia Lialina is a huge artist in net art, and My Boyfriend Came Back from the War (1996) is widely considered one of the most influential early web artworks. She built it using HTML frames and simple black-and-white imagery. Her work invites users to click through a fragmented narrative, a woman recounting a lover's return from war, though the meaning is never fully resolved. The structure of her website is disorienting as images reload within nested frames and text splits or contradicts itself.

This piece illustrates a form of storytelling that is deliberately nonlinear and emotionally ambiguous, almost like a of refusal of clarity. I chose this reference as I found this piece to be visually quite simple but hold a strong conceptual frame work. Her exploration of  emotional awkwardness and shyness really helped inspire the framework of integrating a human voice within an online website. Her work taught me that and online interface can be emotionally expressive, even when technically limited.",https://static.frieze.com/files/inline-images/web-mbcbftw-netscape-3.jpeg, https://elephant.art/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/My-Boyfriend-Came-Back-from-the-War-1996.png," Screenshot from My Boyfriend Came Back from the War, 1996"," Another screenshot from My Boyfriend Came Back from the War, 1996",http://www.teleportacia.org/war/," NetArt, EarlyWeb, Hypertext, Interface"
